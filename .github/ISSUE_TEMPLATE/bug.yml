        ## Please help us help you!

        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Is this clearly a global issue?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if there are stack traces, are they pointing to one file?)
        - Could it be because of my own mistakes?

        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum**. If you are not sure whether it could be your mistakes, ask in the [Discord server](https://ezsys.link/support) first.

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - A screenshot or url to see the problem live (if possible)

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible steps have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!
