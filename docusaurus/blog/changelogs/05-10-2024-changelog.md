# It's time for an update....

## What's coming next?
Due to some internal reasons we decided to release some things after EasySystems V2...
- **Web Support Panel for punishment appeals:**
To improve the customer support experience we decided to create an own support panel for punishment appeals for any EasySystems services including and not limited to the Discord Support Server, app punishments.
