<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between a cold build and an incremental build?</summary>

A cold build is when the Docusaurus caches are empty, generally after running `docusaurus clear`.

An incremental build happens when you run another time the `docusaurus build` command. Docusaurus automatically tries to "re-use" computations from former builds to make subsequent builds faster. In practice it's based on [Webpack persistent caching](https://webpack.js.org/guides/build-performance/#persistent-cache). To enable incremental builds on your CI server, you can persist the `node_modules/.cache` folder across builds.
