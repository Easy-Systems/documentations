> Hello! I am Goose, a **Support Agent** @EasySystems! I am an Aussie who is interested in creative workspaces,

#### What kind of queries and problems do you encounter most often in customer support?
> The problems and queries I get the most normally are about how to set up the bot and use it to its full extent. Normally it is a walk in the park and I guide them through it, every problem is slightly different though.

#### How do you deal with difficult or upset customers and make sure they are satisfied? 
> The main difficulty I face it language barriers. People from all over the world use our bot and language barriers make it harder to have a conversation. We will try to understand the customer as best as we can and see how we can fix their issue. If a customer is unhappy with the bot overall then I would ask for feedback and assess how their needs could be met.

#### What do you like to do in your free time to relax and recharge your batteries?
