Hey **everyone**,  
Weâ€™ve been busy behind the curtain and the result is a **brandâ€‘new experience** for our documentation site *and* blog.
Itâ€™s faster, easier to navigate, and friendlier for contributors than ever before. âœ¨

Over the past few weeks, weâ€™ve rebuilt the foundation, polished the details, and made sure every click feels smoother. Letâ€™s dive into whatâ€™s changed. ðŸ‘‡

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New
- **Performance Boost** â†’ leaner assets, smarter image loading, and fewer blocking scripts for lightningâ€‘fast pages.
- **Streamlined Navigation** â†’ cleaner sidebars, intuitive categories, and better crossâ€‘linking between related content.
- **Smarter Search** â†’ improved relevancy so you find the right page in fewer keystrokes.
- **Better Blog UX** â†’ refreshed listing page, clearer tags, and a more comfortable reading layout.
- **Unified Authoring** â†’ consistent MD/MDX components, shortcodes, and templates for a smoother writing process.

:::tip[Thinking of contributing?]
Weâ€™ve made the *authoring experience* just as smooth as the reading one.
