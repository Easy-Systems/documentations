Hey **everyone**,  
Weâ€™ve been tinkering behind the scenes againâ€¦ and this time itâ€™s our **documentation site and blog** that got a shiny new upgrade! âœ¨

<!-- truncate -->

Over the past few weeks weâ€™ve been reworking the whole experience â€” from performance, to navigation, to how you can actually contribute. Letâ€™s dig in! ðŸ‘‡

---

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New
- **Performance** â†’ leaner assets, smarter image loading, fewer blocking scripts.  
- **Navigation** â†’ cleaner sidebars, more intuitive categories, and better cross-links.  
- **Search** â†’ improved relevancy so you find the right page faster.  
- **Blog UX** â†’ revamped listing page, clearer tags, and a nicer reading layout.  
- **Authoring** â†’ unified MD/MDX components, shortcodes, and templates for consistency.  

:::tip[Quick heads up!]
We didnâ€™t just polish the front-end for readers â€” we also made writing and contributing posts way smoother.  
So if youâ€™ve ever thought about contributing, nowâ€™s a perfect time. ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ’¡ Why We Did It
- **Clarity at scale** â†’ our products keep growing and the docs needed to keep up.  
- **Consistency** â†’ a shared design system across docs *and* blog.  
- **Contributions** â†’ less friction for both our community and team to add content.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means for You
- **Faster answers** with clearer guides + fresh screenshots.  
- **Easier discovery** of best practices, changelogs, and deep dives.  
- **More ways to contribute** if you want to help improve the docs.  

---

## ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next
- Step-by-step tutorials, short video snippets, and product deep dives.  
- More iteration based on *your* feedback: Drop ideas in our [support server](https://ezsys.link/support).
