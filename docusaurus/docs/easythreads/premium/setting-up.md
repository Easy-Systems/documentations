## Step 1: Create a New App

:::info
Please note that enabling the intents is required for the app to work properly. If you don't enable them, your bot will not start, without any error message.
:::

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click **"New Application"** and give your app a name.
3. After creation, navigate to **Bot** settings:
    - Enable **"Message Content Intent"**
    - Enable **"Server Members Intent"**
4. Copy the **Token** and save it for later. Do not share this token with anyone, as it will allow them to control your bot.

## Step 2: Create the Custom Branding App
1. Head over to the EasySystems [Custom Branding Dashboard](https://easysystems.dev/dashboard).
2. Click on **"Create"**.
3. Enter your **Bot Token** from Step 1 and select the **Server** you want to use the app in. 
    1. If the server selection is empty, please make sure you have administrator permissions in the server you want to use the app in.
    2. If it is still empty, try to log out and log back in to the website and clear your browser cache and cookies.
4. Click on **"Create"**.

## Step 3: Invite the Bot
1. After setting your Bots credentials, you will be redirected to the **"Invite"** page.
2. Click on the **"Invite"** button and add the bot to your previously set server.
3. Make sure to give the bot all the required permissions. 

## Step 4: Set Up the Bot
1. You will be redirected to the **"Setup"** page.
2. Set all the Bot settings you want to use. You can always change them later in the dashboard.
3. Verify that the settings are correct and click on **"Save"**.

## Step 5: You are all Set!
Congratulations! You have successfully set up your premium app with EasyThreads. You can now start using the app in your server.
Please note, that it might take a few minutes until the bot is fully set up and ready to use. If you have any issues, please do not hesitate to contact us in our [Support Server](https://ezsys.link/support).
