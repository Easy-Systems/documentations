#  Setup Commands missing

## Issue
If you have added the Bot to your server and you cannot see any setup commands, such as **/autothread** or **/stickymessage**, please check the following issues. If you have checked all the issues and the Bot is still not responding to your command, please contact support.


## Missing Permissions
By default all set up commands require the actual **Administrator** command. It is not enough to have all other permission and having an admin-like administrator role. Please ensure, that you have the the tick in the **Administrator** permission. If you do not have the permission, but you think you should have permissions to use the commands, please ask your server owner to either give you the permission, or to create a permission override for the commands.
They can create a permission override in the Discord Server Settings (Desktop only) by heading to the **Integrations** tab, selecting th Bot. In that tab, they can create the permission overrides for any command they want. If you are not the server owner, please ask the server owner to create the permission overrides for you. 


## Still not working?
Please try to reinvite the Bot to your server using this [invite link](https://ezsys.link/threads). If you are still having issues, please contact support. You can do this by joining our [Support Server](https://ezsys.link/support) and creating a ticket. Please provide as much information as possible about the issue you are experiencing, including the command you are trying to use, the channel you are using it in, your server id, and any error messages you are receiving.
