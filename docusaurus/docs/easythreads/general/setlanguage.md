# /setlanguage
**Default Permissions:** Administrator
## Description
The app is offering a server-wide setting for the **language** of the Bot. As there are many languages you can use the **/setlanguage** command to set the language you want the Bot to use. You can contribute to the translations of the Bot by using the [Translation Tool](https://ezsys.link/translate) or fix any mistakes you find in the translations.

## Options
- **language**: The language you want to set the Bot to. *(required)*

## Examples
```bash
/setlanguage language:German (Deutsch)
```

Please not that your language might not be shown, as Discord only displays the first few languages in the dropdown. You can still search for your language, and if it is available, it will be shown in the dropdown. If you want to use a language that is not available, please use the [Translation Tool](https://ezsys.link/translate) to add it. (You might have to request the language first in our support server, if it is not available in the translation tool.)
