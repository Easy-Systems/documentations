# /timezone
**Default Permissions:** Administrator
## Description
The app is offering a variable for the **date** and one for the **time**. As there is more than just one timezone you can use the **/timezone** command to set a timezone that is used for these variables.  
This will be applied over the entire guild and can be changed at any time.
