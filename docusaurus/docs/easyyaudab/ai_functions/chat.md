## Description
The **/chat** command allows you to talk to an AI model.

Like the default chat function this function has context awareness, which means it will remember your previous messages as well as its' replies to some extent.<br/>
The context is stored per user per channel which means if you used the default chat function before in the same channel using this command will also use that information.<br/>
:::tip
	If you need to reset your context stored for a particular channel you can use the `/resetcontext` command.

## Usage
`/chat text: <Prompt> model: <Model> `

- **\<Prompt\>** The text (also called prompt) you want to give the AI model to responsd to.
### Optional options
