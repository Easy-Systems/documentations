## What is EasyYAUDAB?
EasyYAUDAB is a Discord Bot designed to bring AI right to discord.

You can chat with it, let it generate images or audio files based on your prompts and translate messages.<br/>
The possibilities are theoretically endless and only constrained by your imagination (and our Terms of Service).<br/>
Follow the tutorial below for a basic setup and / or learn more about how to use all its' functions on the following pages!
