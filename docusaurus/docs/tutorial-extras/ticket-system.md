# Setting up a ticket system

In this tutorial we will show you how to set up a ticket system with EasyThreads.
## Prerequisites
- You need to have the [EasyThreads](https://easythreads.xyz/invite) or [EasyThreads Premium / Custom Branding](https://easythreads.xyz/premium) in your server with the proper permissions.
- You have the `administrator` - permission in your server
## Step 1: Create a channel for the ticket system
Create a new channel where the tickets will be created. In our example the channel is named: `ticket-support`.
## Step 2: Create the ticket panel
We are using **[/panel threads](/docs/panels/panel)** to create this ticket panel.
##### Panel Channel:
First you'll set the channel you've just created to the channel the panel will be send in.  
Your command should look like this now:
```/panel threads channel:#ticket-support```  

##### Panel Title:
Next, you'll set the title of the panel with the `embed-title` - param. In our example, we'll use 
> Ticket Support - Plant Friends ðŸª´ðŸŒ± 

##### Panel Description:
Now you can set the description of the panel with the `embed-description` - param. Since we are running in this example a plant server, the description is server-topic related. For our plant server it will be this description:
> "Heya my plant friends!!!
If you need support from the plant team, just click on "Create Ticket" and you can get in touch with us.
Stay hydrated ðŸª´ðŸŒŠ"

##### Panel Footer:
You can set a footer for the panel by using the `embed-footer` - param. We are using a fun fact about fruits and vegetables:
> Did you know: The word "fruit" is a botanical term, while "vegetable" is a culinary term. ðŸŒ±

##### Panel Button:
But how can an user created the ticket?! Exactly! With a button and with the `button-text` - param you can set the text of the button. In our example it will be:
> Create Ticket  

Now you can set the `button-emoji` - param to add an emoji to the button. We use the plant emoji: ðŸŒ±

After this is done, you can set the `button-style` - param to set the style of the button. Since plants are most likely green, we use green.

##### Panel Private Thread:
In order to prevent other server members from viewing user-specific problems, we set the "private-thread" parameter to "True".

##### Panel Thread Message:
You can set a message that will be sent to the user when they open a ticket. This message can be customized with the `thread-message` - param. We dediced to set it in our example to:  
> Welcome \{usermention}, \{newline}   
Tell us here about your problem! \{newline} \{newline}  
> 
> This will only shown to the team.
You opened the ticket on the: \{date}, \{time} in \{guild} 
> \{newline}  \<@&roleid\>
###### Getting your team into the ticket:
Since we've set `private-thread` to "true", only EasyThreads and the user who created the ticket is in the thread. We can change that by **pinging a specific role**.  
In our case we ping the team role and our role id is: `1173692530081144842`

One way to get a specific role id is by going into your server settings > roles and click on the three dots next to the role name or right clicking on the specific role and click on "Copy Role ID"

![Copy RoleID in server settings](../../static/img/BestPractices/TicketSystem/copy_roleid.png)  
You can include your id by replacing "roleid" in `<@&roleid>` with your role id.

##### Panel Thread Name:
You can set the name of the thread with the `thread-name` - param. We are using the following name for the thread:
> ticket-\{user}  

This will create a thread with the username of the user who created the ticket.

##### Panel Embed Color:
You can set the color of the embed with the `embed-color` - param. We are using the color green for our plant server.

##### Panel Block Invites:
You can set the `block-invites` - param to "True". When this is enabled only moderators and the thread creator (EasyThreads) can add new members to the thread.

##### Final Command:
After you've set all the parameters, your command could look like this:
```
/panel threads channel:#ticket-support embed-title:Ticket Support - Plant Friends :seedling: :potted_plant: embed-description:Heya my plant friends!!! {newline} If you need support from the plant team, just click on "Create Ticket" and you can get in touch with us. {newline} Stay hydrated :potted_plant::ocean: embed-footer:Did you know: The word "fruit" is a botanical term, while "vegetable" is a culinary term. :p button-text:Create Ticket button-color:Green private-thread:True thread-message:Welcome {usermention}, {newline} Tell us here about your problem! {newline} {newline} This will only shown to the team. You opened the ticket on the: {date}, {time} in {guild} {newline}  <@&roleid> thread-name:ticket-{user} button-emoji::potted_plant: embed-color:Green block-invites:True
```
![Ticket System command prompt in Discord Text Channel](../../static/img/BestPractices/TicketSystem/command_prompt.png)

Now you have to just hit "enter" to send the command!

And EasyThreads will a ticket panel, in our case it looks like this:
![Sample Plant Server Ticket Panel](../../static/img/BestPractices/TicketSystem/thread_panel.png)

## Step 3: Test the ticket system
After you've set up the ticket panel, you can test it by clicking on the button and creating a ticket.
You should see a new thread created with the name "ticket-\<username\>" and the message you
set in the `thread-message` - param.
You can also test the private thread by trying to view the thread as a non-moderator.
If everything is set up correctly, you should not be able to view the thread as a non-moderator.

For us it looks like this if an user creates a ticket:

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've successfully set up a ticket system with EasyThreads. (*^_^*)**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**A:** `{newline}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{guild}` and `{user}` are **[variables](/docs/general/help#variables)** which you can use within EasyThreads.
