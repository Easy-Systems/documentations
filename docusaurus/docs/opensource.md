##### Step 1.2 (optional): Clone the repository
If you want to work on your local machine, you can clone the repository. You can do this by clicking on the **Code** button and **download the source code as ZIP**. 

Alternately, you can simply replace the github.com with github.**dev** to open an online [Github Codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces).  

You are free to decide whether you want to use the methods in this guide or use your own.

#### Step 2: Make your changes
Now you can make your changes. You can do this directly on the GitHub website or you can clone the repository and work on your local machine.  
In this guide we changed the **README.md** file and added the link to this tutorial!

##### Step 2.1: Commit your changes
If you made your changes, you have to commit them. You can do this by clicking on the **Commit changes** button.  
To make life easier for you and us, please use proper commit names and descriptions! **[You can find the format here](https://github.com/Easy-Systems/documentations/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#semantic-commit-messages)**.

##### Step 2.2: Create a Pull Request
After you committed your changes, you can create a Pull Request (PR).  
Your fork repository should now have a message saying "This branch is x commits ahead of Easy-Systems/documentations:main".  

Click the **contribute** button next to it.

#### Step 3: Wait for the review
Now you have to wait for the review. We will review your PR as soon as possible. If we have any questions or suggestions, we will comment on your PR. In our case everything looks good, so our maintainer can easily accept it.

If everything looks good and we decide that your PR is ready for the live site, we will merge it into our code base and your content will be live with the next update.
